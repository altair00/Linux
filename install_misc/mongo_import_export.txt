There are two ways to import and export in the mongodb


First way you can export collection by collection 
by following this way you can see the collection data 

command:
mongoexport -d 'dbName' -c 'collectionName' -o 'outputfile.json'

mongoimport -d 'dbName' -c 'collectionName' 'inputfile.json'


Second way you can export and import entire database without going
through each collections
by following this way you will not be able to see the data

command:
mongodump -d 'dbName' -o 'folderPath'

mongorestore -d 'dbName' 'folderPath'

remember to install 'mongodb-tools'
otherwise you will wonder where is the binaries
