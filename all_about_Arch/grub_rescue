if you see grub rescue error then you should do...

    first use "set" to see which partition is prefix, root and boot

    then "ls" to list partitions

    "ls (hd0,msdos4)" etc. run this command until you find "Filesystem is ext2" 

    if you find "ext2" defined in a partition then that is the designated one you were looking for.

    then..
    > set boot=(hd0,msdos4)
    > set prefix=(hd0,msdos4)/boot/grub

    or..
    > set root=(hd0,msdos4)
    > set prefix=(hd0,msdos4)/boot/grub

if this problem occurs after windows 10 update in dual boot mode then you should boot into your linux partition and 
have to run "sudo grub-install /dev/sda" also generate a config file by "sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg"
